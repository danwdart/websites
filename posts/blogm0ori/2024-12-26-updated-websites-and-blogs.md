Hi! It's been a while!

I've just released a major new build for all my websites and blogs. It features, amongst other things:

- Fixes for RSS feed readers
- Fixes for rendering older posts
- Separate "tag" and "post" permalink pages for each blog, in order to properly link to them.
- Nice sidebar menus.
- Better mobile layout optimisation.
- Better embeds.
- Different font (do you like it?)
- Various metadata and sitemaps to allow pages and posts to be properly indexed.

Coming soon will be:

- the ability to choose the older font if there's enough demand
- dark mode.
- any suggestions in the next period.

This will also allow me to more frequently write blog posts, so look forward to what's next!

Here is the current list of websites that have now been updated:

- [Personal website](https://dandart.co.uk)
- [Portfolio](https://jolharg.com)
- [Radio ham website](https://m0ori.com)

And blogs affected:

- [Personal blog](https://blog.dandart.co.uk)
- [Code blog](https://blog.jolharg.com)
- [Radio blog](https://blog.m0ori.com)
- [Reviews website](https://madhackerreviews.com)

If you would like to use this package for your own website, I'd be happy to help.
And if you notice anything wrong with it, please let me know.

Ta-ta, and happy Y'all-Tired!
