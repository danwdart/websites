I recently tried a weird type of operating system. It called itself "Windows".

That rings a bell, I had tried it and used it extensively back in my Linux 2.4 days, back when ALSA was on the horizon, and it had a lot of merit. After that, it went downhill fantastically with the introduction of New Technology Technology. Honestly, I think they should have stuck to Old Technology Technology, also known as Disc Operating System.

Jokes aside, let's see what we can and can't do with its latest offering, now that it has finally learned to count.

It finally has an <b>application repository</b>!
This has been a main complaint in most of the versions before. It lacked any kind of centralised application store, and threw its applications about the filesystem like a baby with an unwanted toy, and failed to clean up after itself upon an uninstall, not knowing what it threw about in the first place.

Let's see if this repository has the features a good one should have.



<b>Crapware/Bloatware</b>

<b>Application launcher</b>

<b>File Manager</b>

<b>Archive support</b>

<b>Filesystem support</b>

<b>Case Sensitivity</b>
<b>
</b><b>Access Control</b>

[ Standards ]

Needed more than expected for interoperability, the file systems supported by

[ Explain ExFAT ]
The company sued any applications of its interoperability, so that nothing could use it.
