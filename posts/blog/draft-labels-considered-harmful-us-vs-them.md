political wings and parties may describe a small aspect but it's something someone feels affiliation for no matter what the wings or parties do independent to them they probably won't reconsider because re-learning is harder

let's not do labels and such and see what the logical conclusion is, a choice, a percentage - ABBABABBBABABBBABABBABAB

My particular views

How minds can be changed and with good persuasion they can be.

Well sourced? Well, are they though, I have been accused of using a "far right source" which may be valid but not taken seriously because of the sourcing - fallacious perhaps

which news we trust - which don't make sense

not necessarily bump ground news but otherwise such things. Review a few news comparison websites
