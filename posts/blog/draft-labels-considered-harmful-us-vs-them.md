Story!


B: La/De. Unfortunately too far up and to the right.
N: used to be B but feels more T, but would rather go B than M. Has been informed being far from B is closer to M.
G: would rather be A but M is better than B so ehh whatever.
M: Co/Re. The face of evil. The media pays way too much attention to mocking it, that they don't realise they're inadvertently promoting it.
O: Centrist
W: Disillusioned by both B and M, doesn't like either of them, doesn't know anything about anyone else so spoils their vote.
T: Green
A: Libertarian
R: Still closer to B but alienated by B by being too close to M, so goes for M
D: Me, farther from M than B, would rather vote T than anyone, but 
L: LibDem. Takes votes away from B.

political wings and parties may describe a small aspect but it's something someone feels affiliation for no matter what the wings or parties do independent to them they probably won't reconsider because re-learning is harder

let's not do labels and such and see what the logical conclusion is, a choice, a percentage - ABBABABBBABABBBABABBABAB

My particular views

How minds can be changed and with good persuasion they can be.

Well sourced? Well, are they though, I have been accused of using a "far right source" which may be valid but not taken seriously because of the sourcing - fallacious perhaps

which news we trust - which don't make sense

not necessarily bump ground news but otherwise such things. Review a few news comparison websites
