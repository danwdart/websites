A short one for this evening: you may (or may not) notice that dark mode is now available on all my websites and blogs.

As someone who likes "hacker" themes, I prefer and default to the dark mode css theme, but if your system is setup for light mode defaults, you shouldn't see any difference.

Please let me know if you see any issues with my new theme!

Toodloo!
