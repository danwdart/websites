**The following is personal opinion.**

Hello again, folks!

Politics is super broken, and I'd like to introduce a couple of my own points and opinions.

## What "Wing" are *you* on?

Firstly, I feel like having political "wings" creates more adversity.

People seem to attach to one party or person above another because of nothing but a couple of points, and believe that this is enough to creatformformforme their identity around it.

People who have a strong opinion on a single or few issues who then see that a political figure that agrees on it will attach

Minority rule

Everyone can vote
    Stupidity
    To whom it matters
