On 2012-03-02, I made a list of bugs in the YouTube mobile app and website. Today we're going to investigate how they've dealt with or not dealt with them, ten years on.

1. Current homepage scrolls to top on going back, should resume position.
2. Commenting should not fail, and if this is not an option, should
auto retry failed comments. Many have been lost.
3. When starting a video, one must rotate the screen to resolve the
wrong full-view stretching that appears.
4. Likes should be a navigable playlist.
5. Navigating to a subscribed user shows "Subscribe" button, should
show "Unsubscribe".
6. Video sounds should continue playing (automatically or at an
option) whilst application is in the background.
7. All videos should be playable.
8. Channel Subscriptions should show all users.
9. List of homepage subscription videos should have a longer history.
10. Playlists of a video should be visible, playable and searchable.
11. Comment box should not obscure video.
12. Comment replying should be implemented.
13. Viewing History should be implemented.
14. "An error/problem occurred" message should be more descriptive.
