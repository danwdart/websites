Many support requests don't contain critical information needed to actually support.  
  
Learn how to ask for help by following these instructions:  

*   Make sure all attachments and power are double checked to be secure connections
*   Look for an error message
*   Google the error message
*   Submit your question along with any error related output, custom settings and most importantly steps to reproduce.
*   Wait.
*   Don't pester.
*   Learn English, it's a lot better if you use proper grammar so that people will understand your problem.

  
**Wrong**:  
Help!!! My Linux doesn't want print! I need have my no.  
  
**Right**:  
My brand x model y printer refuses to print on the grounds that I get the coloured light z and my distribution Q tells me that the reason is W when I try to G and then H. Can somebody suggest what steps I should take to resolve this?
