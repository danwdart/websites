### Background

Alright! Before you fire me, roast me or tell me off, let me explain myself.

Whilst it's socially important (in the West at least) to make it on time to wherever you're going, it's not always a problem. My rule of thumb is that I always try to be at least three minutes early for a call, and between fifteen and thirty minutes early to an appointment, depending on how far away it is. But that's not what I'm talking about here.

### Unimportant

What I'm talking about here is not about meetings, nor is it about calls. It is about the everyday. Obviously it's important to make your scheduled events. But for day-to-day stuff, like "do X hours on project Y" or "Make sure that Z feature is working" it seems to me less important to be punctual on a project than getting the work done. The argument I'm trying to make here is that, ignoring team synchronisation, as long as the work is there, the amount of work, effort or results are there, it should matter less when in the day this is done.

### Unreasonable

[TODO FIND THESE]

There have been several studies showing that most people aren't at their full capacity until about 10 AM, so what of this 9 AM - 10 AM? What of all the watercooler discussion about performance lacking because "I've not had enough coffee yet this morning"?

I think if it doesn't ruin team synchronisation, I'd be perfectly happy to come in (and happy to have others come in) slightly later and stay just as late if it'll give more performance overall at the end of the day.

### Unrealistic

Another reason I disagree with 100% punctuality is the situation you're in: what if your train is late? What if you had to stay up for some good reason? What if your alarm didn't go off this morning? There's no point getting angry at someone if they're going to deliver you better, more efficient work if they do it later in the day. This isn't to say some people don't take the mickey, but in this exercise I'm only thinking about people who care about what they do and get the work done anyway.

### Summarily

In summary, because of the the shortcomings of having to deal with time

Perhaps this is why "Flexi-time" and "Core hours" come from in the contracts of employees and contractors, and I'm certainly fully on board with these concepts, but only at their fully realised form (not some "choose your 8 hours a day as long as we choose 6 of them" business).

Something else goes here etc etc
