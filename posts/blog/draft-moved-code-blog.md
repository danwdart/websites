Hey!

I've just moved the code parts of my blog to my company's new blog: ([JolHarg: Blog](https://blog.jolharg,com)) in order to separate my non-code/non-"official" thoughts and opinions from those of my company, for what it's worth. This isn't due to anything I plan to say, but rather so that people who would like code-only thoughts can get them. That's not to say that I'm going to implement tags and RSS. That might also be a good plan at the same time.
