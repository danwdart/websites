Hey everyone. I've just revamped my blog, and I'm now writing it in Markdown using my custom Haskell-based website renderer.

Let's see if I can make sure it goes well.

[Here's the new source to my website builder](https://github.com/danwdart/websites)


Edit 2020-08-16: **Finally** got it DNS'd, because my phone is dead and I had to ask DigitalOcean to disable my 2FA and provide appropriate proofs!

Speaking of proofs, however, I made a [Keybase](https://keybase.io/dandart) - this is a great place to chat, send files or encrypt both files and source control transparently. I should make a tutorial on these kinds of things, so that I can help others learn from my mistakes and make use of untrustworthy cloud services.

TTFN!
