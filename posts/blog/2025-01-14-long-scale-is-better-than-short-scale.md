Hi!

It's been a bit since I've posted anything quite as substantial, so here we go!

I was brought up with what we were led to believe was the "British/French" system of numbers, known as "long scale", which many countries still use, as opposed to the "American/German" version, which apparently Britain now uses, also known as "short scale".

The difference? The powers of ten: 

| 10^n | 1000^n | Short scale       | Million^n | Long scale, -ard | Long scale, thousand |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------- | --------- |------------------| -------------------- |
| 3    | 1      | Thousand          | 0.5       | Thousand         | Thousand             |
| 6    | 2      | Million           | 1         | Million          | Million              |
| 9    | 3      | Billion           | 1.5       | Milliard         | Thousand million     |
| 12   | 4      | Trillion          | 2         | Billion          | Billion              |
| 15   | 5      | Quadrillion       | 2.5       | Billiard         | Thousand billion     |
| 18   | 6      | Quintillion       | 3         | Trillion         | Trillion             |
| 21   | 7      | Sextillion        | 3.5       | Trilliard        | Thousand trillion    |
| 24   | 8      | Septillion        | 4         | Quadrillion      | Quadrillion          |
| 27   | 9      | Octillion         | 4.5       | Quadrilliard     | Thousand quadrillion |
| 30   | 10     | Nonillion         | 5         | Quintillion      | Quintillion          |
| 33   | 11     | Decillion         | 5.5       | Quintilliard     | Thousand quintillion |
| 36   | 12     | Undecillion       | 6         | Sextillion       | Sextillion           |
| 39   | 13     | Dodecillion       | 6.5       | Sextilliard      | Thousand sextillion  |
| 42   | 14     | Tredecillion      | 7         | Septillion       | Septillion           |
| 45   | 15     | Quattuordecillion | 7.5       | Septilliard      | Thousand septillion  |
| 48   | 16     | Quindecillion     | 8         | Octillion        | Octillion            |
| 51   | 17     | Sexdecillion      | 8.5       | Octilliard       | Thousand octillion   |
| 54   | 18     | Septendecillion   | 9         | Nonillion        | Nonillion            |
| 57   | 19     | Octodecillion     | 9.5       | Nonilliard       | Thousand nonillion   |
| 60   | 20     | Novemdecillion    | 10        | Decillion        | Decillion            |

...etc.

The details of this table is probably my best backup as to why I prefer long scale to short scale.

As you can see, the long scale directly comes from the Latin of the power of a million, but short scale comes from what seems to be a hack: "a thousand times the power of a thousand"? "One less than the power of a thousand"?

If you're intent on using a thousands-based system, I have suggested a "power of a thousand" name below,with the added benefit that it divides directly into the long scale without having to add such a "hack factor"!

| 10^n | 1000^n | Silly name      |
| ---- | ------ | --------------- |
| 3    | 1      | Thousand        |
| 6    | 2      | Bisand          |
| 9    | 3      | Trisand         |
| 12   | 4      | Quadsand        |
| 15   | 5      | Quintsand       |
| 18   | 6      | Sexsand         |
| 21   | 7      | Septsand        |
| 24   | 8      | Octsand         |
| 27   | 9      | Nonsand         |
| 30   | 10     | Decsand         |
| 33   | 11     | Undecsand       |
| 36   | 12     | Dodecsand       |
| 39   | 13     | Tredecsand      |
| 42   | 14     | Quattuordecsand |
| 45   | 15     | Quindecsand     |
| 48   | 16     | Sexdecsand      |
| 51   | 17     | Sepdecsand      |
| 54   | 18     | Octdecsand      |
| 57   | 19     | Nondecsand      |
| 60   | 20     | Viginsand       |

This is obviously very tongue-in-cheek, but it's one of the times that a [common usage of numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers) (which I like very much) has disappointed me.

Till next time.
