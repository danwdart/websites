Four years later

Your new life and house are pleasant, and your brickwork hast scarcely a scuff. However, as you look back to the time before your degree, that haunting feeling never left you. The echoes in the streets of the unknown and untold enemy have gone, but in their place lie silence, solitude and, whenever you requested it, friendliness.

As your introduction to construction this afternoon dragged on, there was one question you forgot to ask. Don’t mind it though, everyone misses things, even if they are as big as this.

Signing up to construction class was your first mistake. It might sound an innocuous enough passion, but surely, surely it couldn’t have been the cause of all this, you tell yourself.

Sweet comforts are all you have, when you’re alone on a tiny island in the middle of a lake.

What could it hurt to call for help?

What, indeed?

The rescuer... you seem to somehow recognise him on your special proprietary phone, and then it slowly dawns on you.

It’s **his** voice.
