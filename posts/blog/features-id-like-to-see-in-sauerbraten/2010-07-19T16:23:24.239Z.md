burning things and vehicles can be realized/simulated by scaling flames. In Sauerbraten you can change colours and scale of particles, including flames by pressing PERIOD.
the door script isnt so difficult . If game mode is singleplayer it can be done by pressing ESC/options/ents/trigger and choosing the right triggers for switch and door. So it can be realized for examplethat a door opens if you walk towards it.
But i miss some other things in sauerbraten,too:
\- **_\*.tga as a texture file_**
\-**breakabe things, e.g. glass**
\-triggers for cubes and not only mapmodels (define a number of cubes as a model..)
\-more trigger options:
×trigger move(move sth to a position when u go through trigger)
×trigger movie (yes, I think, then a story will be created)
×trigger hurt(i dont like it to be death immedatley)
×trigger say(a text is displayed on screen when walking through it(e.g. for map-tutorials or quests))
×ladderclip(i know that ladders are possible, but clip is better)
\-smaller grid(yes, i like to have very detailed things)
\-**better gameplay(reloading nessecary, not so high jumps, not so fast running, more weapons, crouching instead of having small playermodels**
\-monsters in Mp(all players fight together against monsters)
\-**vis optimizing(you don't load what u don't see)**
\-teleports/jumppads without sound(or custom sound)
\-...
I think n general that triggers like doors should be realized with material(like clip,lava and so one)so that the trigger shows which cubes/objects should be the action of the trigger
So you dont have to create own models( and animations(difficult)
