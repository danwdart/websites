Welcome to my new tech blog! It's intended for things attributable to JolHarg (e.g. release announcements, tutorials, news, assorted tech things), in order to separate my non-code/non-"official" thoughts and opinions from those of my company, for what it's worth. This isn't due to anything I plan to say, but rather so that people who would like code-only thoughts can get them. I've moved some of my older posts from [my old blog](https://blog.dandart.co.uk) to here if they were better attributed, too. Please let me know if you think I've miscategorised anything. Please also remember to reset your RSS feed reader, if you use the atom feed.

If this is your first time here, my [non-tech blog is here](https://blog.dandart.co.uk), and its [atom feed is here](https://blog.dandart.co.uk/atom.xml)

Also, the comments are back!
