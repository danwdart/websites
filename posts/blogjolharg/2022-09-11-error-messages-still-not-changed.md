It seems that in the last ten months, since the last post about error messages, nothing much has changed.

I am using my best efforts to ensure that in software I create or modify, that error messages are as verbose as they are required to be. However, I have not received the same treatment from other software vendors. It's all very well to need to hide the "real" error message when something internal goes wrong, but at least to have a correct, friendly client-facing error message. Alas, this has not yet happened, despite it being given a chance. Is there ever any other reason for this?

Yours confusedly, and confoundedly...
