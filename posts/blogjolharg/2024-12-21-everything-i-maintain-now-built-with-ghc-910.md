Huzzah! All executable and library targets I build in Haskell are now built with GHC 9.10.

Of course, GHCJS et al are still using GHC 8.10 for now, but the important point is that I've finally upgraded my last two programs from being stuck at GHC 9.4.

I'm on the way to building with GHC 9.12... once everything supports it?

Watch this space...
