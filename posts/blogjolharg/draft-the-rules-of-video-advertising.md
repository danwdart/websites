Almost ten years after my first "[Rules of Website Advertising](#rules-of-website-advertising)" post, I thought I would do a follow up about video advertising. This is a highly contentious subject, and while it pays much better than most other forms of advertising online, it can also be the most annoying and depressing.

This is the one thing we're still plagued with online, unless we're clever enough to use an ad-blocking VPN through our routers.

So, the usual formula, the DOs, and the DO NOTs, some of which will be repeats, some of which are new:

**The DOs:**

1. DO provide relevant content for your users related to the subject material of the video.
1. DO market research about your customers: the more you know about them, the more you know what they like and the more clicks you'll get.
1. DO
1. DO
1. DO try to keep any media included to a minimum.

**The Do NOTs:**

1. Do NOT advertise irrelevant or spam material such as drugs, gambling or uninteresting products.
1. Do NOT preclude or obscure, or break the flow of content in any way (i.e. , no pre-rolls and no mid-rolls).
1. Do NOT change the volume.. This can be especially distracting to
1. Do NOT use flash as this pretty much destroys SEO and ruins experiences, memory and bandwidth.
1. Do NOT take up a lot of screen real-estate, as this can affect content on phones or poorly designed menus.
1. Do NOT prioritise your material over the actual content of the page or provide any sort of delay to get to the content wished.
1. Do NOT take over or modify existing content.
1. Try not to include video at all as this can hurt people's bandwidth.
1. Try not to necessitate a "close" button - they should be non-intrusive enough not to get in the way.

**Some examples of people who do it wrong:**

YouTube is one of the worst offenders because it disobeys every single rule here. But a site such as what AdBard used to do sensibly obeys all the rules.

**Solutions to avoid it as a user**

Ta-ta.
