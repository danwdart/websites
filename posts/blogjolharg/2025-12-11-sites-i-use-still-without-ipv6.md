Earlier this year, I went over [a list of some of the world's top websites](https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2025/03/behind-times-sites-still-without-ipv6-2025/).

I thought this might not be particularly accurate for an actual list of websites one person would use, so I made a small bash script to scrape the websites in my bookmarks (which is synced across phone and desktop, so a good mix of websites).

For now I haven't sorted it by popularity but I wouldn't imagine that it would be too hard to use one of many site ranking tools.

I thought I would go over some of the bigger ones and name and shame and then provide a percentage point for websites which *still* have not gotten themselves an IPv6 address after becoming a draft standard 27 years ago, having a [scheduled global adoption date 13 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_IPv6_Day_and_World_IPv6_Launch_Day) and becoming an Internet Standard *eight years ago*, this is an ancient thing that most public wifi access points I join have never heard of and only exists as far as I can see in corporate offices and private homes, despite it being one of the standards everything must have already adopted years ago.

Out of a total of *4,617 registered domain names* which resolve, I have bookmarked over the last bunch of years, only *2,108 had an IPv6 address* (only *46%*!) which is frankly shocking, leaving the remaining *2,509 IPv4-only* which will be inaccessible to many new setups if they do not upgrade by the time that internet service providers are forced to go IPv6-only. Note that I didn't check the actual availability, this is purely DNS.

A few notable, shocking examples of websites that still have not updated are ProtonVPN, Samsung, AllenAI, Amazon, Pokémon, Arxiv, Nextdoor, CanIUse, Discord, Uber, Mozilla, Imgur, MathsJam, Meetup, Ebay, Sky and Quora along with many gaming, e-commerce, social media, comparator, food and parcel delivery, video hosting, health, government and money handling websites along with many credit agencies, news publications, mobile providers, shops and petition sites.

Quite shocking, as much of a stuck record that it makes me sound.

Next time in the internet infrastructure series, with the recent rise of downtimes in huge CDNs, how about "how many of my bookmarks are powered by AWS and Cloudflare"?
