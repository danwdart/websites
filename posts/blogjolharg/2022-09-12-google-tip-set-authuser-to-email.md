Having lost my cookies a considerable amount of times, and having multiple Google accounts on-the-go in one browser, I am often faced with bookmarks that are out of date, because they point to something like `?authuser=1`, meaning "the second account you happened to have signed into".

Now, you might see where this is going, the second account I happen to sign into one time isn't always the second account I happen to sign into any other time, so it frustrated me considerably until I found this little shortcut:

Just set `?authuser=[email]` instead of `?authuser=[arbitrary number]`!

And yes, this also works with `/u/[email]/` as well as `/u/[arbitrary number]!`
