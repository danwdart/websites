Tbh Facebook being down the other day did have one knock-on effect for me who doesn’t use it.

Adguard DNS got quite a pummeling from folks trying to access Facebook and their entire DNS effectively got DDoSed, leaving nothing getting resolved for a good while.

Meanwhile I over here killed my own internet by disabling DNS on my router for days thinking it would revert to default. Was very confusing as I had adguard hardcoded on my PC as well, but not my phone.

My week went like this:


My phone: "No internet".

Me on my PC: "Huh? But it’s working! See?"
