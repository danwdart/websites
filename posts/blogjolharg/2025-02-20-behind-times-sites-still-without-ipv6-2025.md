Hi!

As of 2025, a lot of the world's top websites do not work on an IPv6 connection, which is slated to become the default for new internet connections, due to IPv6 exhaustion.

Top sites stolen from Wikipedia:

| ------- | ------ |
| Website | Works? |
| Google-owned websites  | Yes |
| Meta-owned websites | Yes |
| X | Partial (Request succeeds but page complains as Fastly CDN has no IPv6 record) |
| Wikipedia | Yes |
| ChatGPT | Yes |
| Reddit | Yes |
| Yahoo | No, first redirect has no IPv6 record |
| Amazon Shopping | No |
| dzen.ru | No |
| Baidu | No |
| Tiktok | No |
| Netflix | Yes |
| Microsoft | Sometimes yes (e.g. microsoft.com, bing.com, office.com), sometimes no (e.g. microsoftonline.com, live.com, sharepoint.com) |
| LinkedIn | Yes |
| Naver | No |
| Pinterest | No |
| Bilibili | No |
| Twitch | No |
| VK | No |
| Mail.ru | Yes |
| Samsung | No |
| Fandom | No |
| Globo | No |
| Canva | Yes |
| DuckDuckGo | No |
