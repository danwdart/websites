Hello all!

It's been a bit.

I've updated my websites to the latest mtl standards to simplify them and make coding them less complicated and am ready to add the newest things related to each of them. I have also added a [blog to my ham radio website](https://blog.m0ori.com)!

As you may or may not be aware, JolHarg (Limited) is no longer a company, but JolHarg is instead an alias - a username, to avoid legal confusion.

Well, that's all for now, more content incoming!
