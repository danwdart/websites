Huzzah! This blog and set of websites has finally been built using the new latest version of GHC.

Whilst it's not doing anything that special, it marks the ability to use this version to compile all its dependencies, which have had to be modified, bug-reported and pull-requested to get it all to work, and worked around when these have not been responded to.

I've forked a bunch of my dependencies to get them to work, and am very happy that I'm free to update the dependencies I use to work for my needs, and that's really the power of free/libre open source software.

I'm actually quite surprised that the release cycle of GHC itself seems so quick, and it's the main libraries that many people use that lag behind.

TTFN!
