I love the game [Sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org/). But I can think of lots of ways I think it could be improved. I'll of course try to help this happen, and might update this list (and add suggestions!).  
  
1\. Proper gravity (including flying objects, perhaps toggle gravity of objects)  
2\. Fire hurts  
3\. Gunge/Poison  
4\. Circles/spheres easy creation  
5\. Saving of objects/big stuff for later  
6\. Admin coop AKA Play God - in which only the master can use editmode - great fun for "playing god" and wreaking havoc when no one else can.  
7\. Heightmaps in multiplayer (H key)  
8\. Breath (eg you die underwater after a while, like in Quake)  
9\. More ambient soundtracks, ambient noises.  
10\. Button triggers (eg you press or shoot something and something happens).  
11\. Proper doors that open or swing  
12\. Moving objects (automatic or manual via button/trigger) - eg trains.  
13\. Large walls of teleport material, for e.g. trains, yourselves.  
14\. Materials that change to others after a certain time, e.g. noclip slowly to air  
15\. Door keys  
16\. Liquid viscosity  
17\. No glitching when you try to put a hole in a pyramid  
18\. More human models  
19\. Gun reloading sequences  
20\. Auto getmap/sendmap (Getmap when you join, sendmap when someone else joins)  
21\. Master newmap restriction  
22\. Grappling hook  
23\. Item capture - person who captures most items without being killed wins.  
24\. Marks on walls from chainsaw  
25\. Flamethrower  
26\. Gravity gun  
27\. Physics gun  
28\. Time/space warping (global/local/gun) (haha)  
29\. Shield/Disarming field  
30\. Turrets  
31\. Vehicles

32\. Flammable items/materials (e.g. wood) with degrading.

33\. M/F Voices (inc. player), not just "captured" but also "lacerated" etc.

34\. Female models?

35\. Customisable music

36\. Panic mode (Fuzzy/red view when player has too much adrenaline)
