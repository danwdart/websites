A couple of years ago, I made a blog post: [The categories of truthfulness of information](http://blog.localhost:8080/#the-categories-of-truthfulness-of). I'm now finding that some of that information is viewed not quite as I had written.

### Lies

So I've recently been researching the meaning of lying, and there seems to be quite the divide.

On one hand, some believe that lying is a deliberate act, and some believe that it directly translates to "untruth", whether deliberate or accidental. What is your understanding?

Would I be lying if I told you something I legitimately believed, which turned out not to be true? Are people actually invested in pseudoscience lying, or is it just the people who told them that?

As soon as I get this blog ready with comments again, I shall also add the ability to poll, so you can easily tell me your side of the story.

That's all for now.
