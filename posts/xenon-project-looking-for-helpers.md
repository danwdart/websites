I started a project some time ago, which is for now called "Codename: Project Xenon".  
  
Xenon is a browser-based GUI designed to be implemented on netbooks. The difference between other netbook OSes and cloud systems is that not only can you test it online, it will also be installed on netbooks - which will update from the Web automatically, giving you updates, and ability to use it without being connected to the Internet due to a local web server instance.  
  
It will have a very small footprint - being built on very few programs, and so will run on very low-end systems, so it will bring life to your old computers as well.  
  
We are now looking for helpers to make this project a reality. If you are a designer or a programmer who can program using any combination of (X)HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP or MySQL, then we would like you to help us out. We are afraid pay is out of the question at the moment, until we start selling subscriptions to the web service, the budget is zero.  
  
If you have any ideas to help the project along, then please give us feedback!
