I think we all have an idea of what the fastest thing is. What I'm interested in asking today is:

What's the fastest object?

It's been done to death, but I'm going to come at it from a different angle:

Fast objects usually look fast because in one moment they're in a completely different place than they were at the previous moment. However, huge objects can go really fast and from very far away don't look like they're going anywhere, usually cosmic objects.

So instead of distance travelled per time unit, to compare apparent speed, I'm going to track the number of object widths per time unit, such that scaled to the same width, we can see which fly past which. Seems like an interesting enough subject to me!

Let's sort a table:
