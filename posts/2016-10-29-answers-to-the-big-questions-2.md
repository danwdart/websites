Hello again!

It's been over 7 years since Answers to the Big Questions 1. But as promised...

<b>How many dimensions are there?</b>

We can perceive the "normal" three dimensions of width, length and height (variously intermingled with "breadth", etc.) with our senses. But can we really? Each of our eyes only sees one two-dimensional slice of the world, and most of us can mix their signals in our minds to produce depth perception. But to really see the whole of the three-dimensional world, one would need to see "behind" objects, would one not?

As three-dimensional beings, we can see the entirety of a two-dimensional world, so it is reasonable to assume that if there were four-dimensional beings, they would see right through the middle of us!

I'm saying all this in terms of spacial dimensions, but many have interpreted time as another type of dimension, making four (so far). Whilst we are not able to precisely control our direction or "speed through time", we are able to control our apparent speed by going very fast in space relative to time as measured by another observer, and this is because time and space are intermingled in ways understood by the field of special (and generally, general) relativity.

If time is a dimension, some have hypothesised (and visualised extremely well at "The Tenth Dimension") that the equivalent to "sideways" in time would be choice or chance (more about that in the "perceive" section), and the equivalent to an "up/down" would be the ability to move through choice or chance after the event has taken place, which is what I believe is the closest to a "dimension jump" where "everything is different" in certain fiction. There are a multitude of extra suggestions about what comes after this, such as different initial conditions in the universe, which would be an analogue to "a different universe" in popular fiction (see the "universe" section). After that comes membranes of Membrane Theory or strings of String or M-Theory, etc., making the number of dimensions exceed 11 in some models. I really hope that we figure out which is the best model for our universe, as there's a lot of "string theory is true" people, similar to religious people, who will believe a thing because it's beautiful and not because it has any evidence (which as far as I've been informed, these "theories" have not).

<b>How many universes are there?</b>

How many do you think there are? If you're a "believer" of Everett's "many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics, then of course we could imagine there to be an infinite number of universes, each linked in a tree-like time structure.
Alternatively, there is a hypothesis that our "big bang" is one of many "pocket universes", making up a "multiverse", meaning that our particular big bangTDIWQDTBITUKD
Yet another hypothesis states that universes can be born into 5th-dimensional black holes.

<b>How far can we perceive?</b>

We have more than the standard five senses classically described, and far more than the standard five tastes (and that picture you saw at school of the tongue having different tastes in different places was of course, as you well know if you have a tongue, complete rubbish). Amongst the missed out senses are many that have been called the "sixth" sense, although there have been estimated to be up to XY senses, so I suppose any "new" sense would be the XY+1 sense, so we should definitely rename that movie. These are... ZZZZZZZZ

In our minds, of course, we have vastly more information we could imagine, but are still restricted in the types of information we can perceive to those we can already perceive. Our mind's "eye", as it is known colloquially, can reproduce many of the vast numbers of senses that we have, to help train us for the future.

Of course, we can time travel in our minds, to remember what has been and to predict what will be, and travel even further than that, as we can imagine what could have been, and what would be if we had changed what could have been. It is this kind of verb confusion so often quoted in literature, and exploited in fiction, which is what makes alternate history and alternate future so fun to me. If you haven't already, you should watch a good example of this which is Fatherland. Some of the ideas portrayed therein are particularly amusing. 

<b>Bonus: If a Roman could chuck wood, would they chuck wood as far as a woodchuck could chuck wood, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?</b>

The real question is of course: what is a woodchuck? I've always wondered.
Well, it's what is also known as a groundhog, but I really love its other name, the whistlepig. If only that film would've been known as "whistlepig day". That'll have been different.

How about you? Is there anything else you'd like to hear about?
