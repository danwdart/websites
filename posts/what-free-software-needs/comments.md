The package system problem come only with propriary software, with FOSS, the package are the problem of package maintainer of the different distributions. The one format is not a real problem for devellopers. If they want to make a package for distribution it is their problems, else it is the package maintener's problem.  
One repository for all distribution is not technically possible, because distribution have different package update system and motivation, many just take stable version (like Debian Stable) and other are bleeding-edge and rolling-release (like ArchLinux) and this is really good, I don't imagine using Debian on my personnal computer and ArchLinux on company server. I also think on different compilation options.  
  
The lack of standard librairies is a problem, but not a big problem, we can easily have 2 ou 3 different librairies without problems.

so, the problem is that there are too many distros doing things too many different ways, and your solution is... to make a new, completely different distro? ;)

@xenom Distros do different things but maybe if we had stable, testing, etc repos for enabling?  
  
@P. Static Oh no, mine is doing way more than fixing these problems. I'd love current distros to overcome this and standardise with each other. Otherwise, maybe a "1-click install" for new repos and packages is in order, which integrates with their package manager, whatever it may be.
