I love them.

As a mathematician I'm obsessed with many forms of number theory, and public perception of mathematics is something that's quite important to me, as grammar is to many people.

I'm going to go all grammar Nazi on you all today, with one of my pet peeves about how numbers are pronounced and translated to words:

Long scale vs. short scale.

For those who don't know:

Long scale: The standard for pronouncing numbers up until recently in Britain, Germany and other countries.

Short scale: A largely illogical American and French system which some other countries adopted (illogically akin to imperial? Maybe.)

It basically goes like this:

<table class="table"><thead><tr><th>Number</th><th>Greek term from number</th><th>Greek term meaning</th><th>Long scale</th><th>Long scale (scientific)</th><th>Short scale</th><th>Short scale (scientific)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1,000,000</td><td>Million</td><td>Million</td> </tr></tbody></table>
