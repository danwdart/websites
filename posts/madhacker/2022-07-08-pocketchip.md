I wanted to write a review about an interesting product I had ordered: the PocketCHIP.

It purported to be a hackable bit of kit that looked really interesting, and I wanted in on this.

Unfortunately, I never received my device, the company went under and I lost all my money.

That was the story of the pocket hackable device that was not to be. Zeroes across the board.

...I should definitely decrease my sodium intake.
