Good morning! I recently purchased a new radio device. This device is an SDR - which means practically that it can be controlled by computer.

Its specs include:
    - a USB interface
    - 1 MHz - 6 GHz I/O range
    - 20 MHz bandwidth (just enough for a small wifi signal and plenty for DAB / TV)
    - ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ dbm (increasable using an amplifier, of course).

It seems like a nice piece of kit, and the software inbuilt looked interesting, and is upgradeable.
I however found the connection software to use it mostly unintuitive.

SDR software available and usable right now includes:
    - gqrx (rx only)
    - sdrangel (tx/rx)
    - gnuradio (difficult to get going).
