Hey everyone.

I've decided to start my year by attempting to continue journalism, and I've heard that companies may lend you "review models" of devices (special versions, sometimes) if you ask nicely.

So, I plan to ask some of the largest companies with UK branches for review models for hardware and software - using the Mad Hacker approach - explaining that this would be for the purposes of "hacks" - doing things that are not normally possible. I'm about to email the PR department of the following companies, so look out for reviews for these in the coming months!

- Intel
- Microsoft
- Lenovo
- IBM
- Acer
- Asus
- Samsung
- Dell
- Sony
- LG
- NVIDIA

Notable exceptions are:
- TSMC, since they don't produce consumer hardware
- HP, since they are known to support genocidal regimes (plus I have had less than satisfactory experiences with their hardware anyway)
- Siemens, who profit from fossil fuel companies which fuel apartheid and human rights violations

** By the way, let me know if any of the above are dissatisfactory picks, or if you think I should include any more! **

Let's see who I'd recommend based on their product quality!

Fingers crossed.
