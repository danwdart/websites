That might indeed be mutually beneficial.

However, you might have misplaced my reviews website. I do have a few other personal blogs and code blogs which may be closer to "hacks" than my reviews website.

I'm planning to add some "what I've learned" or "package of the (arbitrary time period)" posts for Haskell on my code blog soon, which would be closer to "hacks". I might include what I've discovered is possible in Quake soon too.

Thanks
