Hey everyone.

Here's the status of the companies I contacted:

- Intel - complete radio silence.
- Microsoft - bounced, their email box they advertise is broken! I'd expect much better from such a large company.
- Lenovo - complete radio silence.
- IBM - complete radio silence.
- Acer - complete radio silence.
- Asus - complete radio silence.
- Samsung - complete radio silence.
- Dell - complete radio silence.
- Sony - complete radio silence.
- LG - complete radio silence.
- NVIDIA - complete radio silence.

Needless to say, disappointing results from these companies so far. At any rate, more companies recommended to me will be contacted similarly to see if they can prove themselves to at least respond in less than almost 6 weeks (is that unfair to expect some form of communication in this timeframe?)

I of course don't mean to alienate these companies, only to explain that communication is an important trait to have in a person. If they would like to communicate with me, even just to say "Oh, sorry, we don't do that", "What do you plan?" or even "We dislike what you've said about us in your magazine article, so not us, but try X company".

Till next time.
