A lot of conflicts and problems (more than I would normally expect) in fiction are due to people just not listening to reasonable advice - and it's usually the people who are supposed to be authority figures.

You know the stereotype sci-fi novel: thing escapes science lab, scientist warns leaders, leaders ignore warning, world gets infected.

Warring race try to invade more peaceful race, weird guy warns them not to, they all die horribly.

Authoritarian leader tries to control people's privacy, they are advised not to, they end up being deposed.

It goes on...
