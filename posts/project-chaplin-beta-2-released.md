I'm pleased to announce the release of Project Chaplin Beta 2.  
  
Project Chaplin is an open source, free software video sharing platform with support for YouTube and HTML5.  
  
Since release beta 1, the following features have been added:  
  
Search now produces only [CC](https://creativecommons.org/)\-licenced YouTube videos  
Faster loading through use of HTML5 [AppCache](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner/) (where enabled).  
  
The release can be updated [using GitHub](https://github.com/dandart/projectchaplin) or [downloaded as a zip or tar file](https://github.com/dandart/projectchaplin/releases/tag/beta2).  

Please let me know what you think!
