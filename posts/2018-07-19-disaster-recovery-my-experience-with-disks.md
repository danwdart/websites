Btrfs is great
One disk formatted self as installing ubuntu
Moving data from single to multiple disk setup, in order to easily move files, manage snapshots and things
One disk failed to GPT and had to create new unformatted volume after attempting testdisk which said I couldn't have FS outside the volume
Mounted in degraded
But managed to create unformatted and mount properly
