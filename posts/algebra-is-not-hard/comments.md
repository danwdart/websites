I'm not sure if anyone is having a problem with this part. I can see how manipulating polynomials, especially the long division, can feel highly unusual to people.  
  
Besides, algebra \_is\_ hard. ;)  
The fundamental theorem of algebra remains magical for people until much later, when they learn complex analysis, and they have to just believe it. Proving whether a number is algebraic is still a black art.
