title: "A History of Bugs: YouTube"

On 2/3/12, I made a large list of several outstanding bugs that I found in the YouTube app, that simply wouldn't go away.
In this review six years later, I check them out and see where they've got to.

1. Current homepage scrolls to top on going back, should resume position.
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still broken, but "going back" is now a minimise, so they've allieviated a little of this.

2. Commenting should not fail, and if this is not an option, should
auto retry failed comments. Many have been lost.
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seems today, commenting may actually put your comment on a different video than was introduced into.

3.&nbsp;When starting a video, one must rotate the screen to resolve the
wrong full-view stretching that appears.
&nbsp; &nbsp; Full-screen stretching doesn't wrongly happen anymore.

4. Likes should be a navigable playlist.
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is now implemented!

5. Navigating to a subscribed user shows "Subscribe" button, should
show "Unsubscribe".
&nbsp; &nbsp; Usually - however recommendations from non-subscribed users still appear in the "Subscriptions" section.

6. Video sounds should continue playing (automatically or at an
option) whilst application is in the background.
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still not working, so you have to use 3rd party apps for this. They're now trying to monetise this bug fix! It's a bug, not a feature!

7. All videos should be playable.
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still not completely fixed - although the frequency of unplayable videos has gone down significantly.

8. Channel Subscriptions should show all users.
&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm not even sure what I meant by that one. Maybe it was a forgotten feature.

9. List of homepage subscription videos should have a longer history.
&nbsp; &nbsp; Subscriptions have now been moved to their own page, with a long history, but still with scrolling problems.

10. Playlists of a video should be visible, playable and searchable.
&nbsp; &nbsp; This hasn't been created yet.

11. Comment box should not obscure video.
&nbsp; &nbsp; [ TO TEST ]

12. Comment replying should be implemented.
&nbsp; &nbsp; This largely happens by the process of tagging somebody.

13. Viewing History should be implemented.
&nbsp; &nbsp; This exists, but it apparently does more than using it to send you recommendations, it also sends it to its partners without explicit consent, and performs profiling on you.

14. "An error/problem occurred" message should be more descriptive.
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; No updates on this one. I still never know what actually went wrong, so how am I meant to report it or change it?


Score: NUMBER/14
I think they've done relatively well, but they've introduced almost more bugs than they've fixed, and they're paid for this! Hopefully they'll sort out the remaining ones in about six years.</div><div class="yj6qo" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"></div>
