Hello dear, 
  
I apologies for infringing into your privacy via this message but it's very important you go through it. My name is Amira Khanum Sahib us-Sa'ada, daughter inlaw of H.E. Sahib us-Sa'ada. I am married to Prince Sa'Id in Saudi Arabia. 
  
It's a common knowledge that women in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are restricted in so many ways and I am not an exception. I am educated but can't practice my Profession. I am not allowed to drive, venture into any Business/ Investment. I can only be a live-in house wife. 
  
On this premise, I seek your Personal or Corporate Advice and Partnership in a Huge Mutual Beneficial Business/ Investment Opportunity. I will keep it this brief until I hear from you, you can reach me via email (Amirakhanum@saudiroyalfamily.live) 
  
Have a nice day, 
  
Amira  Khanum
