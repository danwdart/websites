# Serverless bits

Notes:
    Build process is silent with recent versions of sls. Use `sudo stack build --docker --docker-image fpco/stack-build:lts-13.30` to build verbosely, otherwise you'll be staring at something blank for potentially hours.

    To pre-grab that, use `fpco/stack-build:lts-13.30`.

    And yes, it does need to be 13.30 rather than the actual snapshot in use, as that's the newest version still compatible with AWS's libc. See: https://github.com/seek-oss/serverless-haskell

    Needs to be sudo to run as system docker as rootless `docker --version` output is incompatible with `stack --docker`. See: https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/5087

    To use offline, you should run `sudo docker pull lambci/lambda:build-provided` if you don't want your first request to hang for a good while. It does this in the background, however it's just a silent nuisance.

Usage:
    Start offline: `sudo sls offline start --useDocker`

TODO:
    Find a way not to rebuild stack programs in deploy so we can deploy as user.
    Investigate a way not to use this library and use our own glibc's binaries or even an AppImage.
