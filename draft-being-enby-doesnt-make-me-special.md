e.g.
my big talk on gender
this will be tangential to my usual content but there are some things to pay attention to
the "no pronouns" thing will make you sound far right when it's funny actually you're far left
don't mention right or left wing though because it's just a differentiator
normally I wouldn't talk about it much it's not a huge and special thing
don't treat me different - but maybe a bit because I feel weirder
People probably need to be treated different based on their social clique but there are basic rules for everyone
treat people based on their interactions with people and choices of how they are
I'm not a snowflake etc.
it's normalised - gender and pronouns feel like invented problems to some with bigger fish to fry but just respect them because it's easy as hell and respectful and it's what I would do
the media depictions shouldn't be weird as hell and stilted and not like how anyone would talk
more people are probably like that but don't feel as genuine because the media depictions are not even close to their idea of how it is for them, a bit normal.
maybe how I would rewrite a couple of them
it doesn't affect anybody
it's just what
