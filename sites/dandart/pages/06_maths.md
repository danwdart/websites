Mathematics has always been a great pastime for me.

I have invented quite a few visualisations and generators for several interesting pieces of mathematics, some of which you can see and try on repos like my projects repo on GitHub ([Haskell examples](https://github.com/danwdart/projects/tree/master/haskell/maths/src), [JS examples](https://github.com/danwdart/projects/tree/master/js/maths))

Some web-based notable (read: working right now) examples are:

- [Continued Fraction Expander](https://danwdart.github.io/projects/js/maths/src/cfe/index.html)
- A set of gravity simulators:
    - [Sun version (left click for planets, middle click for stars)](https://danwdart.github.io/gravity/2/gravity.html)
    - [Black hole version](https://danwdart.github.io/gravity/4/gravity.html)
- [Cell Automata](https://danwdart.github.io/projects/js/maths/src/cellautomata/)
- [Graph and Sound Demos](https://danwdart.github.io/projects/js/maths/src/graphAndSound/)  
    (one of these is actually the answer similar to [the riddle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSL8asTgpzA) I posed on my YouTube channel)
- [Rolling Shutter effect example](https://danwdart.github.io/projects/js/rolling/)
- [Interactive Cardioid (keyboard only)](https://danwdart.github.io/heartish/cardint.html)
- [Random Cardioid](https://danwdart.github.io/heartish/card.html)
- [Circle Reflection](https://danwdart.github.io/heartish/index.html)

My approved [OEIS](https://oeis.org "Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences") sequences are:

- [A275124: Multiples of 5 where Pisano periods of Fibonacci numbers A001175 and Lucas numbers A106291 agree.](https://oeis.org/A275124)
- [A275167: Pisano periods of A275124.](https://oeis.org/A275167)
- [A308267: Numbers which divide their Zeckendorffian format exactly.](https://oeis.org/A308267)
- [A309979: Hash Parker numbers: Integers whose real 32nd root's first six nonzero digits (after the decimal point) rearranged in ascending order are equal to 234477.](https://oeis.org/A309979)
