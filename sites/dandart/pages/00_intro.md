Hello, my name is Dan.

I am a software engineer, mathematics lover, radio ham and musician.

I work remotely to care for my future wife, [Toga Himiko](https://yanderedarling.com/).

I also enjoy discordant and nonsensical commentary.

I can speak about maths, physics, computer science and linguistics at length.

You can find out more by using the links at the top.
