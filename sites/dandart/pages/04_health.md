Both my physical and mental health are very low at the moment, but I am always more than happy to talk about them.

I think I'm addicted to caffeine, which I wouldn't recommend.

I have been diagnosed with the following things, both physical and mental intermingling:

- [short-term memory loss](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/memory-loss-amnesia/)
- [PTSD](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd "Post-traumatic Stress Disorder")
- [Fibromyalgia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fibromyalgia)
- [Asperger's Syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism)
- [ADHD](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd)
- [Anxiety](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder) (with depression)
