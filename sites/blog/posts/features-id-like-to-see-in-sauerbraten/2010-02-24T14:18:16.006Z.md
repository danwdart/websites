for fire hurting just add the death material over the fire  
a few of the things that you want are already in there they are just single player exclusively.  
there are buttons and triggers in sp. for how to make one check out the sauerbraten docs that came with the game. (its under the mapmodal entrie  
in the editing reference). the doors opening thing is just because no one has made a modal with an animation that swings. you can achieve the telewall by making teleports with the tag /newent teleport \[the teledest number\] -1,  
this creates an invisable teleport of which you can create mutiple to  
cover said wall with.  
moving objects are also only in sp.  
use the ent type elevator to go up/down and the type platform to go any other direction. for door keys you just need to setup a script for your map that requires you to get one trigger before the other will do anything. (im a little weak on cubescript but ive seen it done)  
the rest would make awesome additions to the game (burning things and vehicles would be my favorites here)
