My political opinion is multidimensional,in that I do not believe you should pin one's political views down to one or two dimensions.

As such, I will put down my general broad opinions, and my theory is that this post will sway some people, that I'll get some people trying to sway me (and they may succeed with good arguments) but the list of people agreeing and disagreeing will be largely spread across the political compass.

The broad political categories that I have opinions at all on are:

- War
    - Nuclear war

        Remove all WMDs and perform nuclear disarmament

        - Trident

            Remove Trident entirely
- Rights
    - Human rights

        Ensure everyone has them

    - Marriage
    - LGBTQIAP+
- Aid
- Foreign governments
    - Brexit: deal or no deal?
- NATO
- Environmental
- Animals
- Energy
- Health
    - Vaccinations
- Transport
- Money
    - Tax
    - Minimum wage
    - Banks
    - Workers
    - Benefits
- Drugs
- Freedom
    - Speech
    - Religion
- Migration
