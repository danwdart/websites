As a radio ham, I am used to writing times in [Universal Coordinated Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time), and it is my strong opinion that everybody should know how far away they are from UTC at any time.

Meetings are obviously global, now more so than ever before. It's of vital importance that when people do not have a convenient tool (so when speaking for instance) that people use universal time in order to avoid confusion.

Daylight savings' times are always changing, and there could be a difference of perhaps 5 timezones throughout the year between two or three people. This is because even throughout a hemisphere, people typically do not change their clocks at the same time, they may be for example a week off. When someone in one hemisphere is changing their clocks forwards, it could be about time for someone in the other to change their clocks backwards, but it may be another week or so before they do it!

Especially around clock-changing times, it's important to make sure there are no miscommunications, and especially when someone doesn't know the time of year that your clocks turn forwards and backwards, a single reference point should really be used.

And that is why in the first sentence of this blog post when I mentioned being a radio ham, I stressed this. Imagine how complicated logging a contact would be! Whose time do you log it as? What's their timezone? Do you have them all memorised? Do you want to have to look them up all the time? It's best to use one timezone throughout the world and that has been internationally standardised to UTC.

Fun fact: the "Z" at the end of dates you sometimes see stands for Zulu, which is convenient, as Zulu time is the same time as UTC throughout the year, as they don't use daylight savings' time. They've at least got it right.

Whether or not to have daylight savings' at all is always discussed around the times of the transitions and whether or not it helps you shouldn't matter if you're talking across date lines.

TTFN!
