Announcing the release of Project Chaplin.  
  
Project Chaplin is an open source web-based video sharing client, which includes compatibility with HTML5 and YouTube support.  
  
After being in alpha for and being sadly in hiatus for 7 months, I'm pleased to announce the release of the first beta.  
  
Pre-alpha and alpha releases have had rave reviews and we have had a test site (projectchaplin.com) up for a time, but sadly it was not sustainable at the time, but I may put it back up soon enough.  
  
Features include:  
  
A free software, open source licence as standard  
No intrusive adverts  
Import videos from popular video sources  
No restrictions on content by country, IP or government  
Video downloading as standard  
HTML5 WebM as standard  
Live streaming (pluginless)  
Federation through multiple servers  
Live video effects including brightness and contrast  
Easter eggs?  
  
In the pipeline are:  
  
REST APIs  
Blocking on public demand  
Federated APIs  
Public tagging of videos  
Channel subscriptions  
Individual profiles  
Audio downloading
