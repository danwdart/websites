### Filesystem warning

This repository will not clone properly when trying to clone into FAT, HFS, Joliet/CDFS, MFS, NTFS (Win32NS) or ReFS (Win32NS) filesystems, due to the use of their restrictions making them being incompatible with certain characters in filenames.

It is also not recommended to clone into other filesystems not supporting permissions such as ExFAT.
